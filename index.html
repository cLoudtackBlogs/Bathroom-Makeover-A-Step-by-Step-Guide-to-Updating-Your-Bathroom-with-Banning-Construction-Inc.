                <h2>Trends in Bathroom Design: What to Consider for Your Makeover</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to bathroom makeovers, the design trends are ever-evolving. While timeless styles are always in demand, there are certain design elements that are currently trending. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular trends in bathroom design, which can inspire your renovation.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Smart Technology</b> <br>Incorporating smart technology into your bathroom is one of the fastest-growing trends. From smart showers that allow you to control temperature and water pressure with the touch of a button, to heated floors and mirrors with built-in LED lights, the possibilities are endless. These high-tech upgrades add a modern touch while improving convenience and comfort.</li>
                    <li><b>Neutral and Earthy Tones</b> <br>Bathrooms are increasingly leaning towards calming, neutral color schemes. Soft grays, beige, and earthy tones create a serene and spa-like environment. Pair these tones with natural materials such as wood, stone, or marble for a clean and relaxing space.</li>
                    <li><b>Freestanding Tubs</b> <br>Freestanding tubs are a luxurious and stylish addition to any bathroom. Their elegant design makes them a focal point in the room, and they provide a deep, relaxing soak. If space permits, this is a popular option for those looking to create a spa-like atmosphere.</li>
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=minimalist+design&sca_esv=5eae2f8f5e851a2c&rlz=1C1JSBI_enUS1105US1105&sxsrf=AE3TifO_WqyQ2mSDcisu0-QfE58CgDGvVg%3A1748248773434&ei=xSg0aICfGseeseMP7tCm2AY&ved=0ahUKEwjAlfqY3sCNAxVHT2wGHW6oCWsQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=minimalist+design&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAaAhgBIhFtaW5pbWFsaXN0IGRlc2lnbjIEECMYJzILEAAYgAQYkQIYigUyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgsQABiABBiRAhiKBTILEAAYgAQYkQIYigUyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMggQABiABBiLA0jRH1DrCVjIHXABeAGQAQCYAdwBoAHwD6oBBTAuNi41uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIEoAL9A8ICChAAGLADGNYEGEfCAgYQABgWGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgIIEAAYFhgKGB6YAwCIBgGQBgiSBwMxLjOgB-ZXsgcDMC4zuAfsA8IHAzMtNMgHLA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp"><u>Minimalist Design</u></a></b> <br> Simplicity is key for many homeowners, and a minimalist bathroom design focuses on clean lines, open space, and functional fixtures.
